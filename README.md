## Course Description

Being able to analyze and present data visually has become one of the most important skills in data science, finance, and related fields. **Information Visualization** teaches how to design effective interactive visualizations of complex data for understanding, discovery, and presentation.

This course is a blend of theoretical and practical knowledge aimed at developing skills to:
- Ideate, design, implement, and evaluate sophisticated data visualization projects.
- Understand visual encoding, human perception, and practical applications.
- Explore modern visualization topics such as VR/AR, machine learning, and multimodal interfaces.

Through a series of assignments and a final project, students develop hands-on experience in crafting effective visualizations for real-world scenarios.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Expository Visualization

**Objective**: Create a static visualization to effectively communicate insights about the hours of sunshine in U.S. cities.

- **Dataset**: Monthly hours of sunshine in six U.S. cities (1981â€“2010 average).
- **Key Components**:
  - Data transformation and visualization design.
  - Focused on effective visual encodings (e.g., color, scale, and labels).
- **Deliverables**:
  - Static visualization image.
  - Report explaining design rationale and insights.

### Assignment 2: Misleading Visualization

**Objective**: Understand and demonstrate the power of visualizations to inform or mislead.

- **Dataset**: Custom-selected dataset.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Create an **earnest** visualization that transparently communicates the data.
  2. Create a **deceptive** visualization designed to mislead viewers.
- **Key Features**:
  - Subtle design strategies for deception.
  - Detailed rationale for both designs.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Two static visualizations (earnest and deceptive).
  - A report detailing design choices and questions addressed.

### Assignment 3: Interactive Visualization

**Objective**: Develop an interactive visualization to enable data exploration.

- **Dataset**: Custom-selected dataset.
- **Key Features**:
  - Interaction techniques such as filtering, sorting, and highlighting.
  - User-focused interface design.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Deployed interactive visualization (web-based).
  - Video demonstration.
  - Written report with design rationale and interaction explanations.
